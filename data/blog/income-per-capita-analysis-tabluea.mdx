This is the [farmers market and county dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madeleineferguson/farmers-markets-in-the-united-states?select=farmers_markets_from_usda.csv)
this I found on kaggle.

We will be reusing this average household income per household statistuc later, so it will be best to 
store this in a [Common Table Expression (CTE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) 
using the ```with``` keyword.

The first thing I will try to accomplish will be to compare the mean household income of all counties in the United states to the
mean household income of all counties that contain farmer's markets. The first query I created to look at this had some issues
```
SELECT FORMAt(AVG(median_family_income), 'C') AS average_family_income, 
( 
	SELECT FORMAT(AVG(median_family_income), 'C') AS mean
	FROM wiki_county_info
) AS overall_average
FROM fm
LEFT JOIN wiki_county_info
ON fm.county = wiki_county_info.county AND fm.state = wiki_county_info.state;
```

## Which states have the most farmer's markets?
This query returns the total number of farmer's markets per state. Unsurprisingly, California is first. However, it also has the most people
so this tells us very little.
```
WITH states_by_total_market (state, total_markets) AS (
SELECT wiki_county_info.state, COUNT(*) total_markets 
FROM wiki_county_info
LEFT JOIN fm
ON wiki_county_info.county = fm.county
	AND wiki_county_info.state = fm.state
GROUP BY wiki_county_info.state)

SELECT state, total_markets
FROM states_by_total_market
ORDER BY total_markets DESC;
```
```
state	total_markets
California	737
New York	584
Texas	404
Illinois	358
Michigan	342
```

## Which counties do not have farmer's markets, and which states have the most counties with no farmer's markets?
With this query, we can see which states have the greatest number of counties without farmers markets. 
```
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS counties_without_market, 
	wiki_county_info.state AS state
FROM wiki_county_info
LEFT JOIN fm
ON wiki_county_info.county = fm.county
	AND wiki_county_info.state = fm.state
WHERE fm.marketName IS NULL
GROUP BY wiki_county_info.state
ORDER BY counties_without_market DESC;
```
Texas is highest with 174. But does Texas also have a greater number of counties?

Next we will look at which counties have the most farmer's markets

Which characteristic correlates the most with the income of the county that the farmer's market is in?
