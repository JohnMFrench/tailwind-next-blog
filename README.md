# Data Analytics Portfolio Site
This project was forked from [https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog]

## Reasoning

Web development has always been an interest of mine. However, I took a long hiatus from coding â€“ approximately 6 years. Having returned to writing code, I wanted to try out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Skills I'm Learning

I began my re-entry into web development at the beginning of 2022. At this point, I had a somewhat shaky background in javascript, html, and css, solely what I taught myself using [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

The following frameworks, tools, and concepts have been entirely new to me this year:

 - react.js
 - tailwind
 - vs code
 - powershell
 - tableau
 - python
 - of course, next.js

## Roadmap

I intend to continue to work on this site throughout my new career. My next goal is to create some blog posts and setup SEO.
